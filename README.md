# Blackjack MonteCarlo Simulation

## Overview

This Streamlit app provides a Monte Carlo simulation of the popular card game Blackjack. The simulation allows users to explore various aspects of the game, including the house's winning probability, distribution of game outcomes, and analysis of rounds where the house wins.

## Access the Deployed App

You can access the deployed app through the following link: [Blackjack MonteCarlo Simulation](https://karensaraimoralesmontiel-blackjack-montecarlo-app-main-pdun2j.streamlit.app/)

## How to Use

Once you access the app, you can interact with it using the following steps:

1. **Adjust Parameters**: Use the sidebar input fields to adjust simulation parameters such as the number of repetitions, starting balance, bet amount, and rounds per game.

2. **Run the Simulation**: Click on the "Run Simulation" button to start the Monte Carlo simulation. The app will run the simulation based on the provided parameters.

3. **Explore Results**: After the simulation completes, you can explore the results presented in the app. This may include visualizations, statistics, and analysis of the Blackjack game outcomes.
